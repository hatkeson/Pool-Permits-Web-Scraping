# Pool-Permit-Web-Scraping
Web Scraping Project

This program takes the table from https://mcesearch.monroecounty-fl.gov/search/permits/ and scrapes it for all open pool and spa permits in Monroe County, Florida.
It first uses Selenium with Python to scrape and create a csv file, then uses an R script to convert the csv into a Microsoft Excel file.
